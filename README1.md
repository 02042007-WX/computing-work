# I have no idea (Don't ask me)
He grinned, the warm glow reflecting his beautiful, dark brown eyes, "Come over." 

Water dripping from the ends of his messy hair, his body dripping wet. The cool sound of the waterfall drowned out his soft calming voice. 

Smiling, she plunged into the warm water. Picking her up from the depths of the water, his fingers pressing around her waist, as they huddled together. Her hands wrapping around his neck, their heads touching. 

"I love you," he laughed, yet more serious than ever, water running down his sharp jawline. 

"Don't leave this time," his breadth becoming heavy, his voice becoming dry. Other than the crashing sound of water, all was left was their breathing. Her vision turning blur, as she pressed a smile, her chest tightening. She nodded, pulling him closer. 

His hands going closer to her cheeks, pulling her lips close to his. "I don't know how to live without you." 

"Justin..." Sticky liquid began to flow down her cheeks, "You know I can't either." Her heart hammering. She pursed her lips onto his, her hands coming into contact with his soft warm cheeks. 

His lips soft and warm, calming her delicate heart. The dim glow of light pouring through the edges of leaves, showering onto them. As they pulled away, tears were hanging at the edge of her chin. Wipping them away with his thumb, "keep a smile up, "he muttered, "cause I don't want to see you crying because of me."


PLS HELP ME DECIDE - THE ONE ABOVE, OR THIS

He searched all over. 

He ran. He tried. 

Yet it was all black at the end. 

He did not know what he was searching for, something important, something that meant alot more to him. 
All he could see is the black darkness, never ending. 

The feeling seemed to have numbed the extreme pain that were coursing his veins. 
"Jaden..." she gagged, her eyes filled with pain and shock. He clasped his hands on her neck, squeezing every single breath out of her. His eyes filled with happiness and excitement. 

His mind ached, as these horrible scenes flashed across his mind. In that dark place, he broke down. He pain increased rapidly, his face turning red. 
Her dark eyes staring straight at him, her face turning pale. However, he never loose his grip, tighter and tighter. Finger marks could be clearly seen on her neck. 
His head throbed. Pain surging through. 

No, he never did that. 

He would never kill her. 

He loved her. 

"Please..." another voice pleaded. It vocals were female, young, fresh. He sharpened his sickle, as it shined under the frail light. Without second thought, he grinned, plunging it through the poor girl guts. As he slowly twisted the handle, a satisfying sound breaking the painful sobs and silence. Sticky liquid dripped from the wound, staining the girls white dress. Her eyes still fixated on him, her mouth spewing out red liquid. Her hands covered with the dark liquid, tightly gripping onto the edge of the sharp weaponÂ  before crashing to the ground. 

Her eyes still wide open, filled with hate and anger. 

He pulled back the sickle, hurling into a series if wicked laughter. Soft, slippery, jelly like solids slid out of her body. She would utter a word no more. Pain overwhelmed his mind, his crumbled down, the pain crashing into him, like waves crashing onto the rocks near shore. He bent down, dipping his fingers into her fresh blood. As he slowly draw red lines along his cheeks, as it slowly flowed down. 

Like it was some sort of enjoyment.
Taking up a knife, he began skillfully, slice up the fresh feast into small slices, just like a chef filled with passion. Her blood splattering his red stained face, as he licked it with glee. 

No. 

He would never do that. 

More scenes rushed back into him. 

He sat on a girl. Bottom bare. She screamed and struggle. Her hands tied firmly to the bed frame. He ran a knife across her smooth fresh naked body. She never dared to utter a word, her eyes filled with horror. His eyes dark, beautiful, yet menacing. 
"Let's play a little game," he muttered, his fingertips running down her stomach to her thighs. "If you listen good, you will be fine. BUT, if u don't. Well....," he plunged the knife into the mattress missing her cheeks by inches. "I can't save you."

No. No, no, no. 

That was not him. 

No way. 

He left the dark room, his face covered with the familiar red liquid as he gave a creepy cackle of laughter. 

The girl laid on the bed, in an awkward angle. Her eyes dug out, her naked body being stabbed multiple times, as her some if her fingers were just not found connected to her anymore. 

Suddenly, someone pulled him out of the infinite darkness. 

"What are your last words?" 

He was strapped to a chair. 

The chair of death. 

A black cloth had covered his head. 

He could not see anything. 

But he could feel a cold metal device coming in contact with his head. Fear enveloped him. 

"I'M INOCCENT! I NEVER KILL THEM! I CAN EXPLIAN!" 

He began struggling in his seat, as a big strong hand pressed his fidgiting hands tightly onto the chair. Tears began flowing from his eyes, down his sharp, beautiful chin. 
No one could understand why someone who had such a good family and looks would be the serial killer. 

No one. 

"WAIT." 

Someone crashed into the room. 

"HE IS INNOCENT," his breadth uneven. "He has a spilt personality disorder."
