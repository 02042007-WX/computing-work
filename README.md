# I have no idea (Don't ask me)
He grinned, the warm glow reflecting his beautiful, dark brown eyes, "Come over." 

Water dripping from the ends of his messy hair, his body dripping wet. The cool sound of the waterfall drowned out his soft calming voice. 

Smiling, she plunged into the warm water. Picking her up from the depths of the water, his fingers pressing around her waist, as they huddled together. Her hands wrapping around his neck, their heads touching. 

"I love you," he laughed, yet more serious than ever, water running down his sharp jawline. 

"Don't leave this time," his breadth becoming heavy, his voice becoming dry. Other than the crashing sound of water, all was left was their breathing. Her vision turning blur, as she pressed a smile, her chest tightening. She nodded, pulling him closer. 

His hands going closer to her cheeks, pulling her lips close to his. "I don't know how to live without you." 

"Justin..." Sticky liquid began to flow down her cheeks, "You know I can't either." Her heart hammering. She pursed her lips onto his, her hands coming into contact with his soft warm cheeks. 

It felt like opening up her soul, tasting, feeling and seeing every colour of the rainbow in her own way, almost like catching a smile in a bottle, its softness, its sweetnessâ€¦ Like breathing through his soft warm lips, like a cool inhalation of oxygen to warm her soul... 

Nothing in the world exist but them.

She could not put them into words, nor has there been any part of speech or figure of speech invented to describe it. Her hands gripping tighter around his neck. 

Its like an aphrodisiac, mixed with a Pandoras box effect, fireworks glowing deep inside as his lips come into contact with hers.

The dim glow of light pouring through the edges of leaves, showering onto them. As they pulled away, tears were hanging at the edge of her chin. Wipping them away with his thumb, he muttered, "keep a smile up."

"Cause I don't want to see you crying because of me."
