He grinned, the warm glow reflecting his beautiful, dark brown eyes, "Come over." Water dripping from the ends of his messy hair, his body dripping wet. The cool sound of the waterfall drowned out his soft calming voice. Smiling, she plunged into the warm water. He picked her up from the depths of the water, his fingers pressing around her waist, as they huddled together. Her hands wrapping around his neck, their heads touching. "I love you," he laughed, yet more serious than ever, water running down his sharp jawline. "Don't leave this time," his breadth becoming heavy, his voice becoming dry. Other than the crashing sound of water, all was left was their breathing. Her vision turning blur, as she pressed a smile, her chest tightening. She nodded, pulling him closer. His hands going closer to her cheeks, pulling her lips close to his. "I don't know how to live without you." "Justin..." Sticky liquid began to flow down her cheeks, "You know I can't either." Her heart hammering. She pursed her lips onto his, her hands coming into contact with his soft warm cheeks. His lips soft and warm, calming her delicate heart. The dim glow of light pouring through the edges of leaves, showering onto them. As they pulled away, tears were hanging at the edge of her chin. Wipping them away with his thumb, he muttered, "keep a smile up, cause I don't want to see you crying because of me."
