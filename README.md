# I have no idea (Don't ask me)
He grinned, the warm glow reflecting his beautiful, dark brown eyes, "Come over." 
Water dripping from the ends of his messy hair, his body dripping wet. The cool sound of the waterfall drowned out his soft calming voice. 
Smiling, she plunged into the warm water. Picking her up from the depths of the water, his fingers pressing around her waist, as they huddled together. Her hands wrapping around his neck, their heads touching. 
"I love you," he laughed, yet more serious than ever, water running down his sharp jawline. 
"Don't leave this time," his breath becoming heavy, his voice becoming dry. Other than the crashing sound of water, all was left was their breathing. Her vision turning blur, as she pressed a smile, her chest tightening. She nodded, pulling him closer. 
His hands going closer to her cheeks, pulling her lips close to his. "I don't know how to live without you." 
"Justin..." Sticky liquid began to flow down her cheeks, "You know I can't either." Her heart hammering. She pursed her lips onto his, her hands coming into contact with his soft warm cheeks. 
His lips soft and warm, calming her delicate heart. The dim glow of light pouring through the edges of leaves, showering onto them. As they pulled away, tears were hanging at the edge of her chin. Wipping them away with his thumb, he muttered, "keep a smile up, cause I don't want to see you crying because of me."
He searched all over. 


PLS HELP ME DECIDE - THE ONE ABOVE, OR THIS

#No one (everything beneath this is of a same story, or what I assume to be what Wei Xuan intended it to be~ Cherilyn) 
He ran. He tried. 
He picked up speed, just to run into nowhere. 
He did not know what he was searching for, something important, something that was of paramount importance. 
All he could see was the sea of bleak darkness that laid before his eyes. 
Never ending. Infinite. 
He thought that if he ran, he could run away from his problems or perhaps find it. However, his body was slowly coming to a stop, succumbing to sheer exhaustion. 
He felt as though his lungs were going to burst, a fiery feeling emerging in his insides, gnawing at his guts from the inside out.
The feeling seemed to have numbed the immense pain in his gut and consciousness. 
A distant, familiar yet unfamiliar memory flashed into his mind. It was the first time he had ever done this although it was most definitely not the last. 

Encounter #1 Sweet scene of squeezing the life out of my lover <3
"Jaden..." she gagged, her brown eyes filled with betrayal and terror. He clasped his hands on her neck, squeezing every single breath out of her. His eyes were filled with happiness and excitement, a strong sinister aura radiating from him.

His mind ached, as these horrible scenes flashed across his mind. His guilt was killing him, eating at his heart like a parasite. 

Her dark ebony eyes staring straight at him, her face turning peculiarly pale. However, he never lost his grip, instead, tightining it slowly. Finger marks could be clearly seen on her neck. It was evident that fingers were dug into them with utmost ferocity and strength.  
His head throbed. Pain surging through. 

No, he would never do that to her. 
He would never kill her. 
He loved her. 

Encounter #2 World Class Chef 
"Please..." another voice pleaded. Its vocals were female, young, fresh. He sharpened his sickle, as it glistened brilliantly under the frail light. Without second thought, he grinned, plunging it through the poor girl guts. As he slowly twisted the handle, a satisfying sound broke the painful sobs. And then, silence. Sticky liquid dripped from the wound, staining the girl's pure white dress. Her eyes still fixated on him, her mouth spewing out red, crimson liquid. Her hands were covered with the dark ill-omened liquid, with the last breath lingering in her, she clutched it tightly before crashing violently to the ground. 
Her eyes still wide open, filled with that of an expression of anger and hatred before she brutally had her life taken away from her. 
He pulled back the sickle, hurling into a series of wicked laughter. Soft, slippery, jelly like solids slid out of her body. She would utter a word no more. Pain crushed his mind as he crubled downt ot he ground like fine dust, unable to handle the aurging guilt any longer. The pain was crashing into him, like waves crashing onto the rocks near shore. He bent down, dipping his fingers into her open would. As he slowly traced lines on his cheek leaving behind trails of red, as it gently flowed down. 
Taking up a knife, he began skillfully, slice up the fresh meat into small delicate slices, as if he was a chef preparing for a great feast. Her blood splattering his red stained face, as he licked it with glee. 

No. 
He. He would never do that. 

Encounter #3 Stabby stabby 
Her body was crushed under the weight of his. Bottom bare. Her scream pierced through the crisp midnight air, like a metal bullet searing through ones' body. Her hands were tied firmly to the bed frame. He ran a knife across her smooth fresh naked body. Immediately, she ceased her screaming lest he do something much more terrible. She endeavoured preventing the tears pricking at her innocent eyes, threatening to fall. In contrast, his eyes were dark, beautiful, yet menacing. revelling the sweet, sweet little operation he had planned. 
"Let's play a little game," he muttered, using his finger to trace right down her stomach to her thighs. "If you listen good, you will be fine. BUT, if u don't. Well.... I can't save you," he violently stabbed the knife into the mattress missing her cheeks by inches. 

No. No, no, no. 
That was not him. 
No way. 

He left the dark room, his face covered with the familiar red liquid as he gave a creepy cackle of laughter. 
The girl laid on the bed like a limp doll having all her stuffings wrenched out of her body, her lengs bent in an awkward angle. Her eye sockets hollow, her bare body having multiple vicious cuts, some of her fingers disconnected from a body as if a mighty beast has effortlessly torn them off like a measley twig. 


Suddenly, someone pulled him out of the infinite darkness. He fervently hoped that it was someone who would save him. 
"What are your last words?" 
He was strapped to a chair. The chair of death. 
A black cloth had covered his head. 
He was devoid of any vision. But he could feel a cold metal device coming in contact with his head. 
Fear enveloped him. 
"I'M INOCCENT! I NEVER KILLED THEM! I CAN EXPLIAN!" He struggled in his seat, as a large strong hand pressed his fidgeting hands tightly onto the chair. He could not handle all the pressure that were placed onto him. Tears began flowing from his eyes, down his sharp, beautiful chin. No one could make head or tail as of why someone who had a great life with opportunities ahead of him and someone with charming looks like he would commit this monstrosity. No one. Now, no one would even want to save such a monster. 

Suddenly, news flooded into the execution room, breaking the process. "HE IS INNOCENT! He is innocent. The doctors have already proven, he... he has split personality."
